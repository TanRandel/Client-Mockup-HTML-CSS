                <h1>Discover Hair Day</h1>
                <p>
                    Based in Madison, Wisconsin, Hair Day is a boutique hair salon that specializes in cut, color, and styling. Hair Day also offers makeup and nail services, prides itself on its warm and relaxing atmosphere, and is best known for edgy hair colors and on-trend cuts. The salon can only accommodate a small number of coloring appointments each week, so clients need to book far in advance. To keep clients inspired between appointments, the employees share makeup and nail tutorials on the Hair Day website.

            <h1>Meet The Owner</h1>
            <p>Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started specializing in edgy, custom coloring techniques. She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for her clients. Pria opened the salon with her good friend and talented hairdresser, Garry. They have a staff of seven: two stylists, three colorists, one manicurist, and one make-up artist.</p>
